# 8-puzzle solver in C++

Uses the A* algorithm, with manhatten distance as the heuristic function.

## Running the code.

Clone the repo, then

`make`

Run the "main.out" file like

`./main.out 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 0`

which will convert into the starting board:

1 2 3

4 5 6

7 8 0

where 0 is the empty space.
